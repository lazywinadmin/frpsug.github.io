<font color="blue">Registration closing date: Sunday 22nd of September 2019</font>

<u>Two tickets types are available to you:</u>

* **Regular ticket 21€**
* **Student / Unemployed ticket** please read below (Free / Limited)

### Note on the Student/Unemployed ticket

Up to now we organized the previous instances of the PowerShell Saturday in Paris for free. However organizing such event comes with a high cost for the organizers.

We wanted to keep this event accessible to everyone, especially for student and unemployed persons.
For this reason we kept a few free tickets to cover these scenarios. We won't check student card or unemployement information. However keep in mind that you are taking away a spot from someone if you don't meet these conditions :(

We tried to keep the event affordable (21€) so please take the regular ticket if you can afford it :)

Note that the student/unemployed ticket give access to same content as the regular ticket with the exception of the t-shirt (Only regular ticket will get a PowerShell Saturday Paris 2019 t-shirt).

# Recording of the sessions
