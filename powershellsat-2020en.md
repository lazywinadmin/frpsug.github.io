**COVID-19: We’re Postponing The Paris PowerShell Saturday 2020**

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a need for social distancing to help prevent the spread and as yet we are unsure when life will return to normal.

For this reason, we’ve made the difficult decision to postpone our PS Saturday in Paris this year.

We do plan to organize online events instead starting at the end of June (see our [Meetup page](http://frpsug.com/meet)).

We will update this page to give you information about these virtual events

<u>Two tickets types are available to you:</u>

* **Regular ticket 21€**
* **Student / Unemployed ticket** please read below (Free / Limited)

### Note on the Student/Unemployed ticket

Up to now we organized the previous instances of the PowerShell Saturday in Paris for free. However organizing such event comes with a high cost for the organizers.

We wanted to keep this event accessible to everyone, especially for student and unemployed persons.
For this reason we kept a few free tickets to cover these scenarios. We won't check student card or unemployement information. However keep in mind that you are taking away a spot from someone if you don't meet these conditions :(

We tried to keep the event affordable (21€) so please take the regular ticket if you can afford it :)

Note that the student/unemployed ticket give access to same content as the regular ticket with the exception of the t-shirt (Only regular ticket will get a PowerShell Saturday Paris 2019 t-shirt).
